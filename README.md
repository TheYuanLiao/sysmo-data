# Car agents of SySMo model
SySMo stands for Synthetic Sweden Mobility Model (1, 2), which creates a synthetic population, a simplified microscopic representation of an actual population in Sweden. 
Statistically representative of the population, it offers crucial data for simulation models, notably agent-based models, in fields like transportation, land use, economics, and epidemiology.

## Project scope
The project delivers a synthetic replica of **Swedish car users** (i.e., car agents), their household characteristics, activity-travel plans, and detailed traveling along the road network on an average weekday.
This repository documents the methodology of generating these data which can be further used in mobility patterns analysis, agent-based simulations, and studying the impact of electrification of private car fleets in Sweden.
